## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bhargava, a Software Engineer passionate about distributed systems and scale. Currently, I work on ML & AI infrastructure at AWS, where I get to tackle some fascinating challenges in building systems that power machine learning at scale.

## What I Do

- **Professional**: Building and scaling ML & AI infrastructure at AWS
- **Interests**: Distributed systems, system design, performance optimization
- **Side Projects**: Always looking for interesting problems to solve and new technologies to explore

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- **Exploring the Outdoors**: I'm on a mission to visit all national parks in the US by 2030! So far, I've been to [update with your count] parks.
- **Adventure Seeker**: Love hiking, camping, and discovering new trails

## Let's Connect

I enjoy connecting with fellow engineers, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone with interesting stories to share. Feel free to reach out through any of the social links on my homepage, or drop me an email!
