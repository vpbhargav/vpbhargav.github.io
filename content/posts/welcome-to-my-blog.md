## Hello World! üåç

Welcome to my newly redesigned personal website and blog! After running a simple portfolio site for a while, I decided it was time to create a space where I could share more than just my professional background.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will be a mix of different topics that interest me:

### üîß Technology & Engineering
- Insights from working on ML & AI infrastructure
- Distributed systems challenges and solutions
- Performance optimization techniques
- Interesting side projects and experiments

### üèîÔ∏è Outdoor Adventures
- National park visits (working toward that 2030 goal!)
- Hiking and camping experiences
- Photography from the trails
- Tips for fellow outdoor enthusiasts

### üí≠ Personal Reflections
- Lessons learned in tech and life
- Book recommendations
- Random thoughts and observations

## The Tech Behind This Site

For those curious about the technical details:

- **Platform**: Hugo (static site generator)
- **Theme**: PaperMod (customized for dark mode)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions (automated)

I chose Hugo for its speed and simplicity, and PaperMod for its clean, minimalist design that works great in dark mode. The entire site is open source and available on my GitHub.

## What's Next?

I'm excited to start sharing more content here. Some upcoming posts I'm planning:

- Deep dive into building scalable ML infrastructure
- My experience visiting [X] national parks so far
- Lessons learned from recent side projects
- Book reviews and recommendations

## Let's Connect!

I'd love to hear from you! Whether you're interested in discussing technology, sharing outdoor adventure stories, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out through any of the social links on my homepage.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something interesting here!
