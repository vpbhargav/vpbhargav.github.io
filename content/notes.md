## Welcome to My Notes 📝

This is my digital notebook where I capture ideas, thoughts, and things I want to explore. It's a space for thinking out loud and keeping track of interesting concepts that cross my mind.

## What You'll Find Here

###  [Project Ideas](/notes/project-ideas/)
A collection of product and project concepts I'm thinking about. Some might be half-baked ideas, others more developed thoughts. This is where I brainstorm and think through potential side projects or interesting problems to solve.

### [Things to Explore](/notes/explore/)
A running list of technologies, concepts, books, and topics I want to dive deeper into. Consider this my personal learning backlog and curiosity tracker.

## Why Public Notes?

I believe in learning and thinking in public. By sharing these notes:

- **Accountability**: Making my ideas visible helps me follow through
- **Feedback**: Others might have insights or want to collaborate
- **Documentation**: It's interesting to look back and see how thoughts evolve
