## Project Ideas ðŸ’¡

This is my brainstorming space for product and project concepts. Some ideas are just sparks of inspiration, others are more thought-out concepts. I use this space to think out loud and develop ideas over time.

## Current Ideas

### ðŸš€ Active Thinking

*Ideas I'm actively developing or considering*

- Blogging app that captures user audio and uses LLM to clean up and create posts. LLMs are great but I feel audio will be the next major thing in pushing the boundary in the space. Working on this will also help me learn a few things :)

- NotebookLM but for personalized news. User should be able to link to their news apps (NYT) or aggregators (Reddit). The app should process the top stories and create a podcast like new summary for the user everyday.

### ðŸ”„ Revisit Later

*Ideas that might be worth exploring in the future*

**[Add ideas to revisit here]**

## Idea Development Framework

When I capture an idea, I try to think through:

- **Problem**: What problem does this solve?
- **Target**: Who would use this?
- **Approach**: How might I build this?
- **Scope**: What's the MVP vs. full vision?
- **Learning**: What would I learn by building this?

## From Idea to Reality

Some ideas from this list might graduate to actual projects. When they do, I'll move them to the [Projects](/projects/) section and document the journey.
