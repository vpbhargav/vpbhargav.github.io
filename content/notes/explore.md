## Learning Approach

When I explore something new, I try to:

- **Start Small**: Find a simple tutorial or overview
- **Build Something**: Create a small project to apply the learning
- **Document**: Write notes or a blog post about what I learned
- **Connect**: See how it relates to things I already know
- **Share**: Discuss with others or teach someone else
